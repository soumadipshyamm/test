Subject: Leave Application for Sister’s Wedding

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I am writing to request leave on November 18th and 19th, 2024, to attend my cousin sister's wedding. I apologize for the short notice, as I couldn't apply in advance due to some personal commitments.

I assure you I will ensure all my tasks are up-to-date before my leave to minimize any disruption. I hope you will consider my request favorably and approve my leave for these dates.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
