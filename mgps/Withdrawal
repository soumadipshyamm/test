Great — if **users are withdrawing money** from your platform wallet to **their own bank account**, then you’ll need to use **Stripe Connect** with **Standard or Express accounts**, because:

- **Users need Stripe accounts** (to receive payouts)
- You send money from your Stripe platform to their **connected account's bank account**

---

### Flow Summary:

1. User registers & connects Stripe account (once).
2. You store `stripeAccountId` in your DB (MongoDB).
3. User requests withdrawal.
4. You:
   - Check wallet balance.
   - Create a **Payout** via Stripe to their connected account.
   - Deduct the amount from wallet balance.

---

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Connect User to Stripe
Redirect user to onboard:

```js
const account = await stripe.accounts.create({
  type: 'express', // or 'standard'
  email: user.email,
});

const accountLink = await stripe.accountLinks.create({
  account: account.id,
  refresh_url: 'https://yourdomain.com/reauth',
  return_url: 'https://yourdomain.com/return',
  type: 'account_onboarding',
});
```

Save `account.id` (stripeAccountId) to user's MongoDB wallet document.

---

#### 2. Create Withdrawal Endpoint

```js
router.post('/withdraw', async (req, res) => {
  const { userId, amount } = req.body;

  try {
    const wallet = await Wallet.findOne({ userId });

    if (!wallet || wallet.balance < amount) {
      return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Insufficient balance' });
    }

    // Payout to the user's Stripe account
    const transfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
      amount: amount * 100,
      currency: 'usd',
      destination: wallet.stripeAccountId,
    });

    // Now create payout from user's account to their bank
    await stripe.payouts.create({
      amount: amount * 100,
      currency: 'usd',
    }, {
      stripeAccount: wallet.stripeAccountId,
    });

    // Update wallet balance
    wallet.balance -= amount;
    await wallet.save();

    res.json({ message: 'Withdrawal successful' });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Withdrawal failed', error: err.message });
  }
});
```

Would you like the **MongoDB model**, or the **Stripe connect onboarding frontend** as well?
