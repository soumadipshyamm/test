voter account cannot upgrade role to, the form for “address, city, state, and zip,” is disabled.

upon logout, needs to be a link to the homepage on the log-in page.

Super Admin needs ability to create competition. 
super admin must have ability to adjust votes on all competitions, for cases of fraud, or disputed payments, etc.

Date of user register should be recorded and shown in admin and user profiles
date of user upgraded accounts should be recorded and shown in admin and user profiles.

when I updated a user profile image from the admin panel, it did not reflect that change when i logged in as that user.

when creating a competition, the time stamp should be in 12 hour format and allow am/pm choice.
number of participants proceeding to next round should allow a number OR a percentage to choose. right now it only allows a percentage.

I tried to create a new competition but when i got to participant details, it would not let me proceed.
not sure why there is a company name drop down list in the “about competition creator” section. that don’t make sense to me.

main image for competition does not update dynamically yet.
User management link and competition management link is not working on mobile
